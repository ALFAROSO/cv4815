            "I am an Industrial Engineer with experience in HR analysis and logistics. In my previous role, I
            successfully analyzed data for a workforce of 3000 employees and took the lead on a project aimed at
            enhancing data capture during training sessions. Additionally, I gained valuable experience as a bilingual
            assistant at Scotiabank, where I effectively handled calls from customers located in Canada.<br>

            <p>
                During the challenging times of the Covid-19 pandemic, I took the opportunity to explore programming and
                undertook personal projects to further develop my skills. My dedication and hard work in this field were
                acknowledged through the achievement of two scholarships. One scholarship allowed me to study and
                specialize in databases such as MySQL, while the other provided me with the opportunity to focus on web
                development. These experiences instilled in me a greater level of confidence and solidified my interest
                in pursuing related studies abroad, particularly in an English-speaking country.<br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Motivated by my passion for learning, I made the decision to come to Canada to pursue a program in Web and
            Mobile App Development. This choice aligns perfectly with my career aspirations and offers me the chance to
            immerse myself in a dynamic environment that fosters innovation and growth."
